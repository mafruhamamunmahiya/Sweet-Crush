    <h1 class="head2">How to Make:</h1>
    <p>
       <b> To make the donuts-</b>
       <br>
        Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Spray a donut pan well with non-stick cooking spray and set aside.<br>
        In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.<br>
        In a separate bowl, mix together the buttermilk, sugar, egg, butter, and vanilla until well combined.<br>
        Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until just combined.<br>
        Spoon the batter into the donut cavities making sure to only fill them about 2/3 - 3/4 of the way full.<br>
        Bake for 8-10 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the donut comes out clean.<br>
        Remove from the oven and allow to cool for about 5 minutes in the pan. Remove donuts from the pan and transfer to a wire rack to cool.<br>

      <b> To make the glaze-</b><br>
        
    In a separate bowl, mix together the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla, and milk. If the glaze is too thick, slowly add one tablespoon of milk at a time until it has reached your desired consistency.
<br>
Dip the tops of the donuts into the glaze and transfer back to the wire rack to cool and allow the glaze to harden. Top with sprinkles if desired.
