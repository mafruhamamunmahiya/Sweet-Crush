    <h1 class="head2">Ingredients:</h1>
    <p>
        1 cup Parboiled Rice<br>
        2.5 cup Water<br>
        1 tsp salt<br>
        2 liters Full Fat Milk<br>
        3/4 cup Sugar<br>
        50 grams Date Palm Jaggery (Preferably Nolen Gur)<br>
        2 tbsp Vegetable Oil<br>
        1/4 cup Grated Coconut<br>
        1 bay leaf<br>
    </p>
    <h1 class="head2">How to Make:</h1>
    <p>
        Wash and soak rice in the water overnight.<br>
        Grind to a fine paste almost the consistency of a pancake. Add a little water if necessary.<br>
        Chitoi pithe is traditionally made in clay molds. But you can also do the same in small kadhais or frying pans.<br>
        Heat the mold and grease it with a small paper towel dipped in the oil. You have to grease the mold after every batch, so you need the oil even if it looks too much.<br>
        Add the batter and cover it. You will see small bubbles. The pithe gets cooked in about 2-3 mins in all depending on the size of the mold. If required flip and cook a little on the other side too. Remove.<br>
        You could enjoy with grated coconut and nolen gur(liquid) at this stage.<br>
        Alternatively, we could step it up too. In a big wide mouthed pan, heat the milk along with the bay leaf. Bring it to a boil and then let it simmer over medium flame and reduce to half itâ€™s original volume. This takes about 20 mins and a careful eye to avoid the milk from burning.<br>
        Now add the sugar and stir for bout 5-6 mins until it fully dissolves.<br>
        Add the cooked chitoi pithes and simmer for another 3-4 mins. Remove from flame.<br>
        Immediately add the gur (jaggery). Stir to dissolve it. Set aside for 10 mins before serving.<br>
        Garnish with grated coconut and serve.<br>
