    <h1 class="head2">Ingredients:</h1>
    <p>
        1 14 oz. package chocolate sandwich cookies, like Oreos, divided<br>
        3 tbsp. melted salted butter<br>
        2 pt. chocolate-chocolate chip ice cream<br>
        1/2 c. thick hot fudge sauce, at room temperature<br>
        2 pt. coffee ice cream<br>
        1/2 c. thick salted caramel sauce, at room temperature <br>
        1/2 c. toffee bits<br>
        2 pt. vanilla-chocolate chip ice cream<br>
        1 c. hard chocolate sundae topping, like Magic Shell<br>
        1 c. frozen whipped topping, thawed, like Cool Whip<br>
        Maraschino cherries<br>
    </p>
    <h1 class="head2">How to Make:</h1>
    <p>
        Reserve 8 chocolate sandwich cookies and place the remainder in the bowl of a food processor. Process until finely ground, about 1 minute. Drizzle in the butter then process the mixture until it is combined. Transfer to an 8-inch springform pan. Using a flat bottomed glass, press the crust firmly into the bottom of the pan and up the sides. Place in the freezer for 20 minutes.<br>
        Meanwhile, remove 2 pints of chocolate-chocolate chip ice cream from the freezer and let it sit out until slightly softened, about 20 minutes. Scoop the softened ice cream into the crust. Press down with the back of a spoon to push out as many air bubbles as possible and smooth it into a flat layer. Place in the freezer for 2 hours. <br>
        Dollop spoon-fulls of fudge all over the ice cream, then spread it with a spatula, leaving a ½-inch border around the edge. Take the remaining 8 oreos and break them apart into small pieces. Sprinkle them all over the fudge and press gently. Return the cake to the freezer for 2 hours. <br>
        Meanwhile, remove 2 pints of coffee ice cream from the freezer and let it sit out until slightly softened, about 20 minutes. Scoop the softened ice cream all over the cookie layer. Press down with the back of a spoon to push out as many air bubbles as possible and smooth it into a flat layer. Place in the freezer for 2 hours.<br>
        Dollop spoon-fulls of caramel sauce all over the ice cream, then spread it with a spatula, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge of the cake. Sprinkle the toffee pieces all over and press them gently into the caramel. Return to the freezer for 2 hours. <br>
        Meanwhile, remove 2 pints of vanilla-chocolate chip ice cream from the freezer and let it sit out until slightly softened, about 20 minutes. Line the inside of an 8” cake pan with a piece of plastic wrap, making the bottom as smooth as possible and making sure that it comes up the sides. Scoop the softened ice cream into the base of the cake pan. Press down with the back of a spoon to push out as many air bubbles as possible and smooth it into a flat layer. Place in the freezer for 2 hours. <br>
        Remove the cake from the freezer. Open the springform pan lever and remove it from the sides of the cake.<br>
        Remove the vanilla- chocolate chip ice cream layer from the freezer. Pull up on the plastic to pull it out of the cake pan, and turn it, ice cream side down, on top of the caramel and toffee layer. Press this layer into the top of the cake and return the whole thing to the freezer for at least 2 more hours before serving. (Cover with more plastic wrap, if freezing for longer than 2 hours, like overnight).<br>
        Remove the cake from the freezer. Pour 1 cup of magic shell into the center of the cake and push it over the sides of the cake so that it drizzles down the sides. Dollop cool whip on the cake and top with maraschino cherries. Slice and serve immediately!<br>
