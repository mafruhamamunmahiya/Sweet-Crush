    <h1 class="head2">Ingredients:</h1>
    <p>
        ½ cup granulated sugar(100 g)<br>
¾ cup brown sugar(165 g), packed<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
½ cup unsalted butter(115 g), melted<br>
1 egg<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour(155 g)<br>
½ teaspoon baking soda<br>
4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks(110 g)<br>
4 oz dark chocolate chunk(110 g), or your preference<br>
        
    </p>
    <h1 class="head2">How to Make:</h1>
    <p>
        In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.<br>
        Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.<br>
        Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).<br>
        Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.<br>
        Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<br>
        Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.<br>
        Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.<br>
        Cool completely before serving...
