    <h1 class="head2">How to Make:</h1>
    <p>
        1.Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Butter the bottom of the jelly roll pan, then line it with parchment, leaving enough to hang over the sides. The butter will help the parchment stick to the pan when you spread the batter. <br>
        2.In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and baking powder. Set aside.<br>
        3.In a medium saucepan set over low heat, slowly melt the butter, chocolate, vanilla, and salt together, stirring constantly. Once melted, remove from heat.<br>
        4.Stir the brown and white sugars into the chocolate mixture. Add the eggs one at a time, stirring until well combined. Fold in the flour mixture.<br>
        5.Spread the batter in the pan.spread the batter into a thin, even layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes. <br>
        6.Let cool completely. Once cool, use the parchment sides to lift the brownie slab out of the pan. Transfer to a large cutting board.<br>
        7.Cut the brownie in half down the middle from north to south<br>
        8.Beat Ice-cream  on low to medium-low just until it reaches the consistency of soft-serve ice cream.<br>
        9.Spread the softened ice cream in an even layer over the brownie slab on the plastic wrap lined baking sheet. Top with remaining brownie slab. Wrap in the plastic wrap, and freeze for at least two hours.<br>
