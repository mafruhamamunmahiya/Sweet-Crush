    <h1 class="head2">Ingredients:</h1>
    <p>
       
        1/2 gallon vanilla ice cream<br>
2 cups crushed cornflake cereal<br>
1 cup sweetened flaked coconut<br>
4 teaspoons ground cinnamon<br>
3 large egg whites<br>
2 tablespoons sugar<br>
Oil for frying<br>
Chocolate syrup, caramel sauce, or honey for drizzling<br>
    </p>
    <h1 class="head2">How to Make:</h1>
    <p>
        Place six scoops of ice cream, about 3 inches in diameter, on a baking sheet. Freeze for at least 2 hours or until very firm.
        <br>
        In a shallow bowl, combine the cornflake cereal crumbs, coconut, and cinnamon.
        <br>
        Roll the frozen ice cream balls in the crumb mixture. Place them back on the baking sheet and freeze again for at least 30 minutes. Reserve the remaining crumb mixture for the next steps.
        <br>
        In a bowl, beat the egg whites and sugar until foamy.<br>
        Dip the coated ice cream balls into the egg mixture, then roll again in the crumb mixture, coating completely. Freeze again for 1 hour
        <br>
        When ready to fry and serve, heat oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan to 375 F. Remove one ball at a time from the freezer and quickly dip into the hot oil for 8-10 seconds, until crisp and brown.
        <br>
        Quickly remove from the hot oil and place on a chilled plate or in a chilled serving bowl. Serve immediately with a drizzle of chocolate sauce.
