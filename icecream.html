    <h1 class="head2">Ingredients:</h1>
    <p>
        2 cups heavy cream <br>
        1 cup whole milk <br>
        ⅔ cup sugar <br>
        ⅛ teaspoon fine sea salt <br>
        6 large egg yolks <br>
        Your choice of flavoring <br>

    <h1 class="head2">How to Make:</h1>
    <p>
        In a small pot, simmer heavy cream, milk, sugar and salt until sugar completely dissolves, about 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat. In a separate bowl, whisk yolks. <br>
        Whisking constantly, slowly whisk about a third of the hot cream into the yolks, then whisk the yolk mixture back into the pot with the cream. Return pot to medium-low heat and gently cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (about 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer).<br>
        Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cool mixture to room temperature. Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight. Churn in an ice cream machine according to manufacturers’ instructions. Serve directly from the machine for soft serve, or store in freezer until needed.<br>
