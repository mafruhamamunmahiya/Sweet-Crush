    <h1 class="head2">Ingredients:</h1>
    <p>
        1 cup parboiled rice (basmati rice is better), <br>
        2 tablespoon store-bought rice flour, <br>
        a pinch of salt, 2 cup liquid milk, <br>
        1 cup water, <br>
        1 fresh coconut, <br>
        jaggery (prefer khejur gur, <br>
        molasses from silver date palm). <br>
    </p>
    <h1 class="head2">How to Make:</h1>
    <p>
        Soak the rice overnight for at least 5/6 hours. Drain the water and let the rice drained out well. Now grind it in a grinder or coffee grinder and add with the store-bought rice flour with it. <br>
        Mix some water and milk in a way that the flour must seem wet, not dry at all. Neither should it look like batter. Now sieve the flour through the strainer. <br>
        Take two pieces of clean cotton cloth and two small bowls. In the bowl spread some flour, then add the coconut and jaggery. Cover it with another layer of flour. Donâ€™t press too much or else, it will break down while placing it for steaming. <br>
        Cover it with a piece of cloth and put it in the steamer. Tap the bowl slightly, so that you can remove the bowl easily. Remove the bowl and cover the pitha with the remaining ends of the cloth.<br>
        Then steam for 4/5 minutes. Prepare the same way using the other bowl and cloth. You have to remove one pitha and place another. <br>
        After a while, you may serve the hot delicious vapa pitha. Of course, you have to serve the pitha in the hot condition. Only then vapa pitha is very tasty.<br>
