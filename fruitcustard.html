    <h1 class="head2">Ingredients:</h1><br>
    <p>
        2 cups (500ml) + 1/4 cup Milk<br>

        2 tablespoons Vanilla Custard Powder (or mango custard powder)<br>
        
        1/4 cup Sugar (or less, to taste)<br>
        
        2 cups chopped Mixed Fruits (grapes, mango, banana, apple, strawberry or pomegranate<br>
<br>
    </p>
    <h1 class="head2">How to Make:</h1>
    <p><br>
        1. Take 2 tablespoons custard powder in a bowl.<br>
        2. Add 1/4 milk and mix well. Make sure
        
        that there are no lumps of powder.<br>
        
        3. Heat 2 cups(500 ml) milk in a heavy based kadai (or a non-stick pan) over medium flame and bring it to a boil. Stir in between occasionally to prevent sticking.
        <br>
        4. When it comes to a boil, add 1/4 cup
        
        (4 tablespoons) sugar.<br>
        5. Turn off the flame and add milk
        
        custard powder mixture.
        Mix well.<br>
        
        6.
        
        Cook the mixture over low flame until it starts to thicken (5-6 minutes). stirring continuously to prevent sticking or burning of the milk.
        <br>
        7. Turn off the flame and transfer mixture to a large bowl. The custard will thicken as it cools down. Bring it to room temperature and then cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Custard is ready.
        <br>
        8. Chop fruits into small pieces. The
        
        fruits used in this recipe are -
        
        seedless grapes, mango, banana, apple and strawberry. You can add any sweet fruits like chikoo, papaya, pomegranate seeds, blueberry, etc. as per the availability and your choice.
        <br>
        9. After 1 hour, remove the custard from
        
        the refrigerator and add fruits.<br>
        
        10. Mix well and again chill it in the
        
        refrigerator for 1 hour: Fruit custard is
        
        ready for serving.
